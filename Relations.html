    <p>Allied Nation: Silverville. Relationship: Close</p>

    <p>Reason: Both countries believe in the same dictatorial order and value close military alliance.</p>

    <p>Nature of the Relationship: Primarily an alliance founded on trade and military cooperation with a focus. They exchange resources and technology with one another and bolster both economies while together against democratic nations.</p>

    <p>History: decades back, the two nations were significant mining competitors, competing over control of valuable resources. After a number of border confrontations, a peace agreement was signed, and this led to a strong and smart alliance.</p>
